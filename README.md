Spring Integration Templates
============================

This repository contains templates and plugins that will help you to get Spring Integration projects off the ground quickly. For right now the following sub-projects exist:

* Spring Integration STS Plugin and Templates (**si-sts-templates**)

Both the STS support and the Gradle Plugin provide the same set of templates that are located under **si-template-projects**
